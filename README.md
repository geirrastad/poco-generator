# poco-generator

Old school POCO generator. If you're not into EF taking control of the data access layer, use this piece of crap software.
A short note: I lost the sources a few years back, so this first commit is decompiled from dotPeek. No comments  but somewhat recognizable...

It will make data access objects for selected tables, including input validation. 
Heck it can also generate good old ASP CRUDE webpages!

This is really old stuff, but I intend to revive it and update with some modern patterns. Still it's ment to
by-pass Entity Framework (shiver)
